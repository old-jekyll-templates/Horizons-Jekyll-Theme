#### General guide to maintain this web
* Edit members, please go to [_includes](https://github.com/quantchemdev/quantchemdev.github.io/tree/master/_includes) repository, e.g., enter the `postdoc_list.html` file, following the previous `HTML` format to add or remove a postdoc member.
* Edit news, please go to [_posts](https://github.com/quantchemdev/quantchemdev.github.io/tree/master/_posts) repository, e.g., enter the `2021-07-23-irene-phd.md` file, to edit such a `.md` (markdown) file, with this format of file name. To update the [one figure news](https://quantchemdev.github.io/blog/), the figure requires a good resolution and size, e.g., height `490` pixes, width `425` pixes, all figures should more or less match this ratio. The height should be always larger than weight size, otherwise, the figure would be twisted ugly by the web layout set.
* Edit publications, please go to [publications.html](https://github.com/quantchemdev/quantchemdev.github.io/tree/master/publications.html), add new publications following the previous `HTML` format.
* Edit openings, please go to [openings.html](https://github.com/quantchemdev/quantchemdev.github.io/tree/master/openings.html), following the previous `HTML` format.
