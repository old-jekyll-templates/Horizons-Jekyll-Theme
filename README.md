#### General guide to maintain this web
* Edit members, please go to `_includes` repository, e.g., `postdoc_list.html`, following the previous `HTML` format to add or remove a postdoc member.
* Edit news, please go to `_posts` repository, e.g., `2021-07-23-irene-phd.md`, to edit such a `.md` (markdown) file, with this format of file name. To update the [one figure news](https://quantchemdev.github.io/blog/), the figure requires a good resolution and size, e.g., height `490` pixes, width `425` pixes, all figures should more or less match this ratio. The height should be always larger than weight size, otherwise, the figure would be twisted ugly by the web layout set.
* Edit publications, please go to `publications.html`, add new publications following the previous `HTML` format.
* Edit openings, please go to `openings.html`, following the previous `HTML` format.
