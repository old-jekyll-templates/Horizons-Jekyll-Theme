  <p>We offer a two-month summer internship at the Quantum Chemistry Development group to work on aromaticity. Stipendium: 750â‚¬/month. The call is open for applications until the end of March. We are looking for candidates who would consider doing a Ph.D. (or/and a master thesis) in our group after the internship.</p>
  <p<In this work, the candidate will learn how to quantify aromaticity using computational chemistry. She/He/They will get acquainted with concepts like electron delocalization, delocalization error, aromaticity in large macrocycles, as well as the electronic and magnetic aspects of aromaticity. From this knowledge, she/he/they will explore in detail the relationships between electron delocalization errors and electronic and magnetic measures of aromaticity in several large macrocyclic structures.
