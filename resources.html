       <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> <font color="#000000"> <b> Electron Sharing Indices 3D (ESI-3D): <br>			
           <b> </font> A program developed by Eduard Matito to perform calculation of electron delocalization indices (two- and various-centers), aromaticity indices (FLU, PDI, HOMA, MCI, Iring, AV1245, AVmin) using the atomic overlap matrices that can be obtained from a Hilbert partition or a real-space partition such as the quantum theory of atoms in molecules.<br>

(contact Eduard Matito for the most recent version of the program).<br>
 <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> <font color="#000000"> <b> DMn:  <br>
           <b>  </font> A program developed by Eduard Matito to compute density matrices of an arbitrary order from the CSF or Slater determinant expansion of a CASSCF or CI calculation. <br>
    <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> <font color="#000000"> <b> APOST-3D: <br>
           <b>  </font> A program developed by Pedro Salvador and Eloy Ramos-Cordoba to perform calculations of atomic populations, bond orders, local spin analysis and effective oxidation states, among other capabilities. <br>
 <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> <font color="#000000"> <b> Donostia Natural Orbital Functional open-source program (DoNOF): <br>
<b>  </font> A program developed by Mario Piris to perform calculations using natural orbital functional theory (also known as reduced density matrix functional theory). Eduard Matito implemented the parellel version of the code. <br>
