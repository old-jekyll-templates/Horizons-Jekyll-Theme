Electron Sharing Indices 3D (ESI-3D): 
		   <br>
					  A program developed by Eduard Matito to perform calculation of electron delocalization indices (two- and various-centers), aromaticity indices (FLU, PDI, HOMA, MCI, Iring, AV1245, AVmin) using the atomic overlap matrices that can be obtained from a Hilbert partition or a real-space partition such as the quantum theory of atoms in molecules.<br>

(contact Eduard Matito for the most recent version of the program).<br>
